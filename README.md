## 🌿 Brand Philosophy

Chai Culture is rooted in **Indian heritage, ritual, and warmth**.  
The goal of this page is not to shout, but to **invite** — reflecting the quiet confidence of a luxury brand.

Every design and technical choice prioritizes:
- Restraint over excess  
- Craft over gimmicks  
- Calm over hype  

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- Light, warm theme inspired by parchment, chai tones, and brass accents  
- Serif + Sans pairing (Playfair Display + Inter) to balance heritage and modern clarity  
- Minimal layout with generous spacing to evoke luxury and confidence  
- Muted gold accent used sparingly to avoid visual noise  
- No heavy animations — premium brands whisper, they don’t shout  

The page is fully **mobile-first** and optimized for clarity across all screen sizes.

## 🧠 UX & Product Thinking

This “Coming Soon” page is designed as a **pre-launch touchpoint**, not a placeholder.

Key considerations:
- Clear brand positioning within the first few seconds  
- A single, focused call-to-action (email waitlist)  
- Calm micro-copy that respects the user’s attention  
- Graceful success and error handling during email submission

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS (v4)**
- **Lucide Icons**
- **Sonner** (toast notifications)

The project follows clean separation between UI and API logic, with a simple backend endpoint to simulate waitlist signup.
